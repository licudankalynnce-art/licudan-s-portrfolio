    <h1> My Top 5 Favorite Movies </h1>
    <hr/>

    <h2>The Greatest Showman</h2>
    <video controls width="400" height="300">
        <source src="../ASSETS FOLDER/VIDEOS/The Greatest Showman.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <p> This movie is one of my favorite movies because it's about following your dreams and being yourself. </br> 
        I'm a big fan of musicals and this movie has amazing songs and performances. </br>
        The story is inspiring and the visuals are stunning. And their song "From now on" is  </br>
        the most memorable for me, because it always reminds me of my Mo. Belen family,  </br>
        my section way back in senior high school.
    </p>

    <h2>Tangled</h2>
    <video controls width="400" height="300">
        <source src="../ASSETS FOLDER/VIDEOS/Tangled.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <p> I am really a big fan of Disney movies and Tangled is one of my all-time favorites. </br>
        The animation is beautiful, and I really love the songs, especially "I See the Light". </br>
        And I'm really looking forward to watch the live action which was said to be released this year. 
    </p>

    <h2>Despicable Me</h2>
    <video controls width="400" height="300">
        <source src="../ASSETS FOLDER/VIDEOS/Despicable Me 3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <p> I really love this movie because the minions are so cute and funny. </br>
        And I love it when they sing, even though i can't understand their language.  </br>
        I also love the bond of Groove with his minions, they're just so funny.
    </p>

    <h2>The Boss Baby</h2>
    <video controls width="400" height="300">
        <source src="../ASSETS FOLDER/VIDEOS/The Boss Baby.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <p> This movie is really interesting and funny at the same time. </br>
        And one thing that I really like about this movie  </br>
        is the bond between the two brothers. This movie really amazed me because  </br>
        it is somehow related to real-life banter between two brothers, the hate to  </br>
        love bondings and etc. are just so cute.
    </p>

    <h2>The Book of Life</h2>
    <video controls width="400" height="300">
        <source src="../ASSETS FOLDER/VIDEOS/The Book of Life.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <p> This movie is full of love, and I really like how the characters bond with each other. </br>
        The songs that are sang by the characters are also really good that it can make the audience </br>
        feel happy and overwhelmed at the same time.
