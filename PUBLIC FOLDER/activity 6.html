    <h1> Biography </h1>
    <p> I am Kalynnce Lianne E. Licudan, an 18 year-old student of Western Mindanao State University ESU-IPIL CAMPUS taking up the  </br>
        course of Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I'm currently living in Kinner Lapaz, Naga, Zamboanga Sibugay Province.  </br>
        My birthday is on <a href="../PUBLIC FOLDER/activity 3.html"> October 2, 2007</a>. 
        I am the only child of Cheno B. Licudan and Geraldine B. Espanol. </br>
        Ever since I was a child, I am already living with my grandparents. That is because my mother left me when I was just 
        7 months old. </br> I was left with my father, but since he also needed to sustain me with my needs, he had let </br>
        my grandparents take care of me. And until now I am still with my grandparents. </br>
        </br>
        I studied in Crossing Sta. Clara Elementary School, during my elementary days. And at Marcelo Spinola School during my high </br>
        days. And speaking of high school, it was the most memorable moment of my life because of course, I've met a lot of people, </br>
        I've met my friends, and I've found another family, which is my classmates. It was a roller coaster ride of emotions, but, it was </br>
        also something that I will cherish the most. </br>
        </br>
        As an introvert person, I really enjoy being alone while doing my hubbies which is, playing guitar, playing mobile games, </br>
        singing, and lastly, watching movies. I am also an adventurous person, I love exploring, but since my grandparents are strict, </br>
        I am not usually allowed to explore and go anywhere. But, I kinda like it sometimes because I'm not really sociable. And as </br>
        for my personality as a person, I am really silent at first but when we get to know me and we become close with eaach other, </br>
        then that's the time that you will able to witness my playful side. </br>
